# === WHAT IS COMMAND PROMPT? ===

# Command Prompt (cmd) is a text-based interface on Windows
# - It's a black window where you type commands instead of clicking
# - Also called "terminal", "console", or "command line"
# - Allows you to run programs and navigate your computer with text commands

# HOW TO RECOGNIZE COMMAND PROMPT:
# - Black window with white text
# - Shows something like: C:\Users\User>
# - Has a blinking cursor waiting for you to type

# === HOW TO GET PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN ===

# STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

# 1. Go to GitHub.com and make sure you're logged in
# 2. Click your profile picture (top right corner)
# 3. Click "Settings" from the dropdown menu
# 4. Scroll down in the left sidebar and click "Developer settings"
# 5. Click "Personal access tokens"
# 6. Click "Tokens (classic)" 
# 7. Click "Generate new token" button
# 8. Click "Generate new token (classic)"

# TOKEN SETTINGS:
# - Note: Type "My Project Token" or "VS Code Git Access"
# - Expiration: Select "No expiration" (or 90 days if you prefer)
# - Scopes: Check the "repo" checkbox (this gives full repository access)
# - Scroll down and click "Generate token"
# IMPORTANT:
# - Copy the token immediately - you won't see it again!
# - NEW FORMAT: github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# - OLD FORMAT: ghp_1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
# - Save it somewhere safe (like Notepad) for now
# - Use THIS token as your password when git asks

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - If you can't find "Developer settings", go to github.com/settings/tokens
# - If token doesn't work, make sure you copied it completely
# - If you lost your token, delete it and create a new one

# === TERMINAL COMMANDS - STEP BY STEP ===

# STEP 1: Open Command Prompt
# - Press Windows + R
# - Type "cmd" and press Enter
# - You should see: C:\Users\User>

# STEP 2: Navigate to your project folder
cd /d "C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\project"

# STEP 3: Initialize Git (run these one by one)
git init

# STEP 4: Configure your Git identity
git config --global user.name "Daiyyan Holmes"

git config --global user.email "daiyyanholmes88@gmail.com"

# STEP 5: Add all files to staging
git add .

# STEP 6: Commit your files
git commit -m "feat: my first project completed"

# STEP 7: Connect to GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/daiyyanholmes88/Myfirstproject.git

# STEP 8: Set main branch
git branch -M main

# STEP 9: Push to GitHub (will ask for credentials)
git push -u origin main

# WHEN STEP 9 ASKS FOR CREDENTIALS:
# Username: daiyyanholmes88
# Password: [PASTE YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN HERE]

# === FINAL ACTION CHECKLIST - DO THESE NOW ===

# STEP 1: ✅ REPOSITORY ALREADY CREATED
# Repository exists at: https://github.com/daiyyanholmes88/Myfirstproject

# STEP 2: OPEN TERMINAL AND RUN COMMANDS
# - Press Windows + R
# - Type "cmd" and press Enter
# - Copy and paste each command from the "QUICK START SUMMARY" section above
# - Press Enter after each command
# - Wait for each command to finish before running the next one

# STEP 3: WHEN GIT PUSH ASKS FOR CREDENTIALS
# Username: daiyyanholmes88
# Password: [YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN] (not your GitHub password!)

# === STATUS CHECK ===
# ✅ Repository created on GitHub? YES
# ⏳ Terminal open and in correct folder?
# ⏳ Personal Access Token ready?
# ⏳ All commands from QUICK START SUMMARY executed?

# If all ✅ then visit: https://github.com/daiyyanholmes88/Myfirstproject
# You should see your files there!

# === PRACTICAL EXAMPLE - COPY THESE EXACTLY ===

# Here's exactly what to type in Command Prompt:

# EXAMPLE SESSION:
# PS C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\project> git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\project> git status
 
# IF PROJECT IS ALREADY CONNECTED (most likely):
# Just update with your latest changes:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: update project with latest changes"
git push origin main

# IF PROJECT IS NOT CONNECTED YET:
# Run the full setup:

git init
git config --global user.name "Daiyyan Holmes"
git config --global user.email "daiyyanholmes88@gmail.com"
git add .
git commit -m "feat: my first project completed"
git remote add origin https://github.com/daiyyanholmes88/Myfirstproject.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# === WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN TERMINAL ===

# When you run git add .:
# (no output - that's normal)

# When you run git commit:
# [main abc1234] feat: update project with latest changes
# 3 files changed, 25 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)

# When you run git push:
# Username for 'https://github.com': daiyyanholmes88
# Password for 'https://daiyyanholmes88@github.com': [PASTE YOUR TOKEN HERE]

# Success looks like:
# Enumerating objects: 5, done.
# Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
# Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 523 bytes | 523.00 KiB/s, done.
# Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
# To https://github.com/daiyyanholmes88/Myfirstproject.git

# === COPY ONE COMMAND AT A TIME ===
# Don't copy multiple lines - do one command, press Enter, wait, then do the next!

# === HOW TO USE THE TERMINAL - PRESS ENTER GUIDE ===

# YES - Press Enter after EVERY SINGLE command!

# HERE'S THE EXACT PROCESS:
# 1. Copy one command (example: cd /d "C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\project")
# 2. Paste it into the black command prompt window
# 3. Press ENTER
# 4. Wait for the command to finish (cursor will return with C:\...)
# 5. Then copy the next command
# 6. Paste it
# 7. Press ENTER again
# 8. Repeat for each command

# EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'LL DO:
# Type: cd /d "C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\project"
# Press: ENTER
# Wait for: C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\project>
# 
# Type: git init
# Press: ENTER
# Wait for: Initialized empty Git repository...
#
# Type: git config --global user.name "Daiyyan Holmes"
# Press: ENTER
# Wait for: C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\project>
#
# And so on...

# IMPORTANT:
# - Press Enter after EVERY command
# - Wait for the next prompt (C:\...) before typing the next command
# - If a command is taking a long time, that's normal - just wait
# - Only type ONE command at a time

# === WHAT PRESSING ENTER DOES ===
# - Enter tells the computer to RUN the command you just typed
# - Without Enter, the command just sits there and does nothing
# - After pressing Enter, wait for the prompt to return before continuing

# === AFTER YOU'VE RUN ALL COMMANDS ===

# 1. VERIFY EVERYTHING WORKED
# After your last command (git push -u origin main), you should see:
# "To https://github.com/daiyyanholmes88/Myfirstproject.git"
# * [new branch] main -> main

# 2. CHECK YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY
# Open your web browser and go to:
# https://github.com/daiyyanholmes88/Myfirstproject
# You should see ALL your project files listed there!

# 3. CLOSE COMMAND PROMPT
# You can now close the command prompt window - you're done!
# Type: exit
# Press: ENTER
# Or just click the X to close the window

# 4. YOUR PROJECT IS NOW ON GITHUB! 🎉
# - Your files are backed up in the cloud
# - You can access them from anywhere
# - Others can see your work (if repository is public)
# - You have version control for future changes

# === FOR FUTURE UPDATES TO YOUR PROJECT ===

# When you make changes to your files later:
# 1. Open Command Prompt again
# 2. Navigate to project: cd /d "C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\project"
# 3. Run these three commands:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe what you changed"
git push origin main

# That's it! Your changes will be updated on GitHub.

# === SUCCESS! YOU'VE LEARNED ===
# ✅ How to use Command Prompt
# ✅ How to initialize Git repository
# ✅ How to connect local project to GitHub
# ✅ How to push code to GitHub
# ✅ How to update your project in the future

# === VS CODE INTEGRATION - VISUAL GIT WORKFLOW ===

# Now that your project is connected to Git, VS Code will show changes visually!

# WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN VS CODE:

# 1. SOURCE CONTROL PANEL (Left sidebar)
# - Click the branch icon (3rd icon down)
# - Shows: "Changes", "Staged Changes", "Commits"
# - Red dots next to modified files
# - Green "+" next to new files

# 2. FILE CHANGES INDICATORS
# - Modified files show "M" next to filename
# - New files show "U" (untracked)
# - Deleted files show "D"

# 3. EXAMPLE: When you modify index.html
# VS Code shows:
# ├── Changes (1)
# │   └── M index.html
# └── [Stage All Changes button]

# === VS CODE GIT WORKFLOW (Alternative to Command Prompt) ===

# Instead of using Command Prompt, you can use VS Code:

# STEP 1: Make changes to your files (edit index.html, styles.css, etc.)

# STEP 2: In VS Code Source Control panel:
# - See your changes listed under "Changes"
# - Click "+" next to files to stage them (same as `git add`)
# - Or click "Stage All Changes" (same as `git add .`)

# STEP 3: Write commit message in text box at top
# - Type: "feat: updated website design"
# - Press Ctrl+Enter to commit (same as `git commit`)

# STEP 4: Click "Sync Changes" or "Push" button
# - This uploads to GitHub (same as `git push`)

# === EXAMPLE OF CHANGES VS CODE SHOWS ===

# When you edit a file, VS Code displays:
# ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
# │ Source Control          (1) M   │
# ├─────────────────────────────────┤
# │ Message: [Type commit message]  │
# │ ✓ Commit    ↑ Sync Changes      │
# ├─────────────────────────────────┤
# │ Changes (1)                     │
# │   M styles.css         +        │
# └─────────────────────────────────┘

# This means:
# - styles.css was Modified
# - Click "+" to stage the change
# - Type message and click "Commit"
# - Click "Sync Changes" to push to GitHub

# === VISUAL DIFF VIEWER ===

# Click on any changed file in Source Control to see:
# - Left side: Original code (red background)
# - Right side: Your changes (green background)
# - Line numbers showing exactly what changed

# This makes it easy to see what you modified before committing!

# === BOTH METHODS WORK ===
# - Command Prompt: More technical, precise control
# - VS Code: Visual, beginner-friendly interface
# - Both do the same thing - choose what you prefer!

# === PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN NOT WORKING? TROUBLESHOOTING ===

# COMMON REASONS YOUR TOKEN FAILED:

# 1. TOKEN WAS COPIED INCORRECTLY
# - Make sure you copied the ENTIRE token
# - NEW tokens start with "github_pat_" (fine-grained tokens)
# - OLD tokens start with "ghp_" (classic tokens)
# - Your token starting with "github_pat" is CORRECT and newer!
# - No spaces before or after the token
# - Copy it exactly as shown (case-sensitive)

# 2. WRONG SCOPES SELECTED
# - You MUST check the "repo" checkbox when creating token
# - Without "repo" scope, you can't push to repositories

# 3. TOKEN EXPIRED
# - If you set expiration, the token may have expired
# - Check expiration date in GitHub settings

# 4. USING WRONG USERNAME
# - Make sure username is exactly: daiyyanholmes88
# - Not your email, not your display name

# === HOW TO CREATE A NEW TOKEN (STEP BY STEP) ===

# STEP 1: Delete the old token first
# - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
# - Find your old token
# - Click "Delete" next to it

# STEP 2: Create new token
# - Click "Generate new token"
# - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
# - Note: "My New Project Token"
# - Expiration: "No expiration"
# - Scopes: CHECK "repo" (full control of private repositories)
# - Scroll down and click "Generate token"

# STEP 3: Copy the new token IMMEDIATELY
# - Select ALL the text (it's very long!)
# - Right-click and copy
# - Paste it in Notepad to save it
# - NEW FORMAT: github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# - OLD FORMAT: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# === TEST YOUR NEW TOKEN ===

# After creating new token, test it:
cd /d "C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\project"
git push origin main

# When prompted:
# Username: daiyyanholmes88
# Password: [PASTE YOUR NEW TOKEN - NOT YOUR GITHUB PASSWORD]

# === ALTERNATIVE: USE GITHUB DESKTOP ===

# If tokens keep failing, try GitHub Desktop app:
# 1. Download GitHub Desktop from desktop.github.com
# 2. Sign in with your GitHub account
# 3. Clone your repository: https://github.com/daiyyanholmes88/Myfirstproject
# 4. Make changes and commit through the app

# === STILL NOT WORKING? CHECK THESE ===

# 1. Make sure repository exists:
# Visit: https://github.com/daiyyanholmes88/Myfirstproject
# If you see "404 Not Found" - create the repository first

# 2. Check if you're signed into correct GitHub account
# 3. Try incognito/private browser window to create token
# 4. Make sure you have internet connection

# The token should work if created correctly with "repo" scope!
