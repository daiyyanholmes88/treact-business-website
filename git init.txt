# === WHAT IS COMMAND PROMPT? ===

# Command Prompt (cmd) is a text-based interface on Windows
# - It's a black window where you type commands instead of clicking
# - Also called "terminal", "console", or "command line"
# - Allows you to run programs and navigate your computer with text commands

# HOW TO RECOGNIZE COMMAND PROMPT:
# - Black window with white text
# - Shows something like: C:\Users\User>
# - Has a blinking cursor waiting for you to type

# === HOW TO GET PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN ===

# STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

# 1. Go to GitHub.com and make sure you're logged in
# 2. Click your profile picture (top right corner)
# 3. Click "Settings" from the dropdown menu
# 4. Scroll down in the left sidebar and click "Developer settings"
# 5. Click "Personal access tokens"
# 6. Click "Tokens (classic)" 
# 7. Click "Generate new token" button
# 8. Click "Generate new token (classic)"

# TOKEN SETTINGS:
# - Note: Type "My Project Token" or "VS Code Git Access"
# - Expiration: Select "No expiration" (or 90 days if you prefer)
# - Scopes: Check the "repo" checkbox (this gives full repository access)
# - Scroll down and click "Generate token"
# IMPORTANT:
# - Copy the token immediately - you won't see it again!
# - It looks like: ghp_1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
# - Save it somewhere safe (like Notepad) for now
# - Use THIS token as your password when git asks

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - If you can't find "Developer settings", go to github.com/settings/tokens
# - If token doesn't work, make sure you copied it completely
# - If you lost your token, delete it and create a new one
